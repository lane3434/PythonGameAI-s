ake a snake game in python with all of the rules. then make a AI that can play the game. use reinforcement learning aswell. allow the ai to know this: where it is, what direction its facing, left wall distancer, right wall distance, food distance, food direction, body length, distance to floor, distance to roof, where body ports are. and i would like you to do this in a GUI but not pygame pls. save the model and load the model. also when it dies get the best snakes brain and copy it to model_best.pth and load that file on startup. but also make it copy the brain to all other snakes. and repeat. I WILL NOT TOLORATE EXAMPLES. i have a fun idea lol. allow me to select number of snakes and put them all into 1 game with same food location but snakes dont colide with each other jusut walls, themself like the normal game. then i would have options to select to view best, all and more! give the snakes rewards when they get closer to the food and less when they get further away but th more food they eay the more points. also let it be in 1 GUIand color each snake diffrsntly and when i press S save it or when i press M cange between best and all  when i press T change it to dark/light mode MAKE IT IN ONE GUI DONT USE 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 ONLY 1 please use CUDA for GPU usage.
